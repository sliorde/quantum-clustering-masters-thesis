# quantum-clustering-masters-thesis
Matlab code that was used in the MSc thesis of Lior Deutsch (a link will be provided when available).


The functions: 

* PreProcessSpectrum.m - preprocess a spectrum to make it clusterizable by QC.
* QuantumClustering.m - perform Quantum Clustering on data.
* HierarchicalQuantumClustering.m - perform Hierarchical Quantum Clustering on data.
	
Dependencies for the two latter functions:  Optimization Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
	
	
A larger set of functions for quantum clustering, its visualization and its variants, coded in other platforms, will be accumulated in https://github.com/sliorde/quantum-clustering.
